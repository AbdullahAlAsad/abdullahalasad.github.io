This project involves the development of a modern, cutting-edge Point of Sale (POS) system, where I serve as the feature lead for the Flutter-based application suite. The project outputs include the primary POS APK, Kitchen Display System (KDS) APK, Customer Display System (CDS) APK, and a lightweight Mobile POS APK.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Application Development:** Create and maintain multiple APKs for POS functionalities tailored to specific operational needs.
- **Hardware Integration:** Develop plugins for integrating essential hardware such as printers, weight scales, and bump bars.
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Collaborate with stakeholders, including the Line of Business (LOB) and Design Teams, to ensure feature alignment and project success.
- **Agile Practices:** Participate in and help conduct agile Scrum and Scrumban meetings, fostering transparent communication and sprint efficiency.
- **Quality Assurance Support:** Provide customized APK builds to assist QA teams and streamline testing processes.
- **CI/CD Collaboration:** Work with CI/CD teams leveraging Jenkins to automate deployment pipelines and ensure reliable software delivery.
- **Code Reviews & Testing:** Review pull requests, write unit tests, and maintain high-quality code standards.

This project highlights my ability to manage complex software development processes, engage with diverse teams, and deliver robust, scalable solutions tailored to the needs of modern businesses.
